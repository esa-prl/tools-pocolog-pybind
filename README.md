Python bindings for rock tools-pocolog_cpp
This repository provides Python bindings for the pocolog tools [](tools-pocolog_cpp). As it relies on the mentioned `tools-pocolog_cpp` component, these Python bindings require a full rock installation. This repository needs to be cloned into `~/rock/tools/pocolog_pybind`.

Assuming the home folder corresponds to `/home/user`, we can install the Python bindings:
```
python3 -m pip install /home/user/rock/tools/pocolog_pybind
```
